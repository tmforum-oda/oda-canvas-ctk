# ODA Canvas Use-Case library, BDD and TDD



This repository contains:
* The [use-case library](usecase-library/README.md) that defines the component - canvas interactions.
* [BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development) features and scenarios](BDD-and-TDD/README.md) that describe each interaction in each use-case using examples.
* TDD (Test-Driven Development) that defines tests for each BDD scenario (embedded within each BDD).

This is *WORK IN PROGRESS* and will eventually form the compliance test kit for an ODA Canvas implementation. The original MVP canvas CTK is referenced below.
